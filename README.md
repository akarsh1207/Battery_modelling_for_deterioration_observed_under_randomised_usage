# Electrochemical Modelling For Li-ion Battery To Account For Deterioration Observed Under Randomised Usage

Welcome to the repository containing the culmination of my internship project at Siemens Energy R&D Gurugram, India. This repository houses the codes developed during my internship period from February to July 2023. The project, titled "Electrochemical Modelling for Li-ion Battery to Account for Deterioration Observed under Randomized Usage," was conducted within the Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) Department.

This internship project significantly contributes to the understanding of battery degradation by involving theoretical insights, code implementation, and rigorous validation. Drawing inspiration from a published experiment [[1]](https://papers.phmsociety.org/index.php/phmconf/article/view/2490), the study focuses on specific cycling processes inducing battery cell degradation. The journey spans understanding the experimental dataset [[2]](https://data.phmsociety.org/nasa/), establishing a theoretical foundation, implemention in Python, and exploring electrochemical modeling with formulas from a reference paper [[3]](https://papers.phmsociety.org/index.php/phmconf/article/view/2252). A vital phase involves crafting a degradation model, optimizing key parameters like total capacity and internal resistance through the Nelder-Mead Method. The model's fidelity is confirmed via comparisons with the publication's results, attesting to its accurate reflection of degradation patterns. Further expanding, the study enhances the model to predict degradation across various discharge levels. A linear regression analysis aligns statistical measures with the reference publication, while model application to diverse battery datasets affirms its versatility. Ultimately, this project holds promise for applications in battery-powered systems, offering insights into battery degradation's intricate dynamics. Feel free to explore the codes and documentation to delve deeper into this enriching journey. Your feedback is invaluable as we collectively navigate the complexities of battery technology.
